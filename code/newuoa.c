/* This subroutine seeks the least value of a function of many variables, */
/* by a trust region method that forms quadratic models by interpolation. */
/* There can be some freedom in the interpolation conditions, which is */
/* taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to the second */
/* derivative of the quadratic model, beginning with a zero matrix. The */
/* arguments of the subroutine are as follows. */

/* N must be set to the number of variables and must be at least two. */
/* NPT is the number of interpolation conditions. Its value must be in the */
/*   interval [N+2,(N+1)(N+2)/2]. */
/* Initial values of the variables must be set in X(1),X(2),...,X(N). They */
/*   will be changed to the values that give the least calculated F. */
/* RHOBEG and RHOEND must be set to the initial and final values of a trust */
/*   region radius, so both must be positive with RHOEND<=RHOBEG. Typically */
/*   RHOBEG should be about one tenth of the greatest expected change to a */
/*   variable, and RHOEND should indicate the accuracy that is required in */
/*   the final values of the variables. */
/* The value of IPRINT should be set to 0, 1, 2 or 3, which controls the */
/*   amount of printing. Specifically, there is no output if IPRINT=0 and */
/*   there is output only at the return if IPRINT=1. Otherwise, each new */
/*   value of RHO is printed, with the best vector of variables so far and */
/*   the corresponding value of the objective function. Further, each new */
/*   value of F with its variables are output if IPRINT=3. */
/* MAXFUN must be set to an upper bound on the number of calls of CALFUN. */
/* The array W will be used for working space. Its length must be at least */
/* (NPT+13)*(NPT+N)+3*N*(N+3)/2. */

/* SUBROUTINE CALFUN (N,X,F) must be provided by the user. It must set F to */
/* the value of the objective function for the variables X(1),X(2),...,X(N). */

/* Partition the working space array, so that different parts of it can be */
/* treated separately by the subroutine that performs the main calculation. */
